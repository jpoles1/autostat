# How To Run

1) [Install poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation) for python dependency management
2) Tell poetry to install the venv locally for this project using `poetry config virtualenvs.in-project true`
3) Install project dependencies using `poetry install`
4) Run the Python Notebook using your editor of choice (I prefer VSCode) using the venv created using poetry
